# Kanban 看板

A simple webapp for viewing OmniFocus data.

## Installation

Requires [pow](http://pow.cx). Data in this is collected using my own gem, [jcache](https://github.com/jyruzicka/jcache). You might need to make some changes to `app.rb` to pull in your own data.

## Questions, comments, etc.

This is really an example of how I achieve stuff rather than a ready-to-run solution to all your kanbanning needs, but if you have any questions as to how I'm achieving stuff, ask away!
